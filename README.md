## In this application, I created a basic logo generator. The user is prompted to enter three letters. Then they are asked what color they'd like the letters to be, what color they'd like their background shape to be, and whether they'd like their shape to be a circle. square, or triangle. The application then generates a .svg file with the logo they've chosen.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The user creates a basic logo through answering the prompts from this application.

## Credits

I receieved guidance on this application from my instructor, JD Tadlock in class. I also referred to ChatGPT to help me figure out where my syntax was incorrect.
